Okay, so here is my current plan for how the game should be setup. 
There are a number of isolated systems of this game which can be developed seperately untill we have something which can be used for a demo.
Some of these have already been started...

Parser: should be able to load and save ated, uted, cep, sps and other files.
Sound: should have a comprehensive system for loading and playing sound effects and music
Loaded: this is the intro to the game, I will have to rewrite this with comments

Some other components which must be written...


Engine: ties everything togeather, executes mob ai's, calculates and tracks damage, health, drops, etc.
Player: keeps track of player's non-engine data, interfaces with parser to load/save. 
Interface: player input, inventory display, HUD etc.
Compositer: composes maps from loaded parts, creates render layers, renders to screen each frame.
Network: creates connection server, connects to other servers, must interface with engine and player code. This is the hardest part.


Some down the line things...

Generator: this will be needed if we want any sort of proceduiral generation of landscapes.
Dialog: for chat between players and between ROOT and the player. 

As for now, I want to start working on the compositor/displayer. I think everything else fans out from there.
However I really want to hammer out how the whole thing should work first, because this part needs to be well designed.
We should discuss it on mumble later.
